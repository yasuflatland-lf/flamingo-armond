# Pick one data-loading mode per component

> Part of the [pagination](../../.claude/rules/pagination.md) rules. Cross-referenced by `docs/backend.md` and `docs/frontend.md`.

A component that accepts both an SSR-prop variant (`{ initial: T }`) and a query-id variant (`{ id: string; query }`) ends up with `useState(props.initial ?? "")` or similar — the state initializes once before the query resolves and stays at the empty default. The two modes are not interchangeable. Decide at the call site (RSC seed vs. client-driven fetch) and keep the component single-mode. If both modes are needed at different routes, write two thin wrappers around a shared presentational component instead of branching inside.
